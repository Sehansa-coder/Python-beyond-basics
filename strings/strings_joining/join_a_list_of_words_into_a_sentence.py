# We use the format of "seperator".join(list elemet) to make a list of items into a string.
# Below is an example

words=["Python","is","awesome"]
print(words)
# Output as a list
# Therefore : 
# To convert the elements insilde the list, use .join() function 
# " " is added between every element in the list
sentence=" ".join(words)
print(sentence)

# output :
# Python is awesome
